I just realized it's 32 bits, not 24 bits, so you can't directly do the
bitshift thing on the f32 from the message, after converting to binary. More
research is required. All hail Skynet. Also, remember to actually git shit up.
That way it REALLY won't matter what computer I'm using, dig? Cool. Nice.

Also when I generalized the toBinary function it totally crapped out.
Current answer from bin_test should be 25, iirc. Not 14.25.
