Okay, so here's how it works:
-roscore
-roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
-rosrun my_package repub.py (assuming the workspace is sourced [it is])
-cd /misc/projects/reichler
-firefox pc_working/pcTest.html
-rosrun pcl_ros pcd_to_pointcloud pcds/<something>.pcd

currently i have ~/.bashrc sourcing my catkin_ws directory by default.
it is questionable whether or not this is a good/permanent thing. don't
forget that it was done and probably should be reverted at some point.

Issues with the current "implementation":

it's slow as heck. source of slowness unsure, but it can almost definitely be
sped up.

it relies on my_package/repub.py, which has to parse a huge goddamn string for
no reason due to an apparent bug in the implementation of uint8[] messages.

it can only handle little-endian data, and assumes float32 storage.

it doesn't do anything with fields other than x,y,z,rgb.

it seems to be defaulting to little squares: being able to change that might
be nice. maybe on the website put radio buttons for shape, and allow input to
change the size of the points. this is probably the least threatening issue.
