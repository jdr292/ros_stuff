What I'll need to make and/or do:
- pointcloud2 message generating thing (i.e. that thing I already have)
- pointcloud2 message parser in JS (need to figure out how to do that)
- figure out if markers can be resized or if i can use a three.js object for      the points. accomplish this by means of testing w/ python publishers and rviz.
- figure out how the graphics libraries work (i.e. how to show stuff w/ three)
- integrate that with ros3djs to display with their viewer
- if pointcloud2's are too hard to directly parse, create service that converts   to pcd and then parses it
- hope it works
